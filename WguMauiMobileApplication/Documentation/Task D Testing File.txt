Task D: Testing App Documentation
**(Note for grader: this page is text only. A copy of this page as a Word Document will be provided with images inside, verifying each 
successful unit test and manual test.)**

1. Test Plan:
The application was tested using a combination of manual testing and unit testing to validate functionality, UI flow, and database interactions.

Goals:
-Verify correctness of CRUD operations (Terms, Courses, Assessments).
-Ensure navigation between pages functions as expected.
-Confirm notifications, validation, and data persistence work properly.

Test Environment:
Platform: .NET MAUI
Database: SQLite (via SQLite-net ORM)
Devices: Android Emulator (Pixel 5/6/7, API 33/34)

Sample Test Cases:
Test Case ID	Description	Steps	        Expected Result	Pass/Fail
TC-01	        Add new Term	            Navigate to Terms → Add Term → Enter details → Save	New term appears in list	✅
TC-02	        Add new Course	            Select Term → Add Course → Enter details → Save	Course appears under correct term	✅
TC-03	        Validate instructor email	Enter invalid email in Add Course form	Validation error shown	✅
TC-04	        Add Assessment	            Select Course → Add Assessment → Enter details → Save	Assessment appears in list	✅
TC-05	        Notification fires	        Create assessment with due date today → Check notification	Notification appears on device	✅
TC-06	        Delete Term	                Select Term → Delete	Term and related courses/assessments removed	✅
TC-07	        Share notes	                Add note → Click Share → Choose SMS	Note text available in message	✅

2. Unit Test Scripts:
Unit tests were written using NUnit framework for key database operations.

using NUnit.Framework;
using System.Threading.Tasks;
using SQLite;
using WguAndroid.Services; // <-- Make sure this matches your namespace

namespace WguAndroid.Tests
{
    public class DatabaseServiceTests
    {
        private DatabaseService _db;

        [SetUp]
        public async Task Setup()
        {
            _db = new DatabaseService(new SQLiteAsyncConnection(":memory:"));
            await _db.Init();
        }

        [Test]
        public async Task AddStudent_Should_SaveStudent()
        {
            var student = new Student { Name = "Test Student" };

            await _db.SaveStudentAsync(student);
            var students = await _db.GetStudentsAsync();

            Assert.That(students.Count, Is.EqualTo(1));
            Assert.That(students[0].Name, Is.EqualTo("Test Student"));
        }

        [Test]
        public async Task AddCourse_ShouldSaveAndRetrieve()
        {
            var course = new Course { Name = "C971 Mobile Dev", InstructorEmail = "prof@wgu.edu" };
            await _db.SaveCourseAsync(course);

            var courses = await _db.GetCoursesAsync();
            Assert.AreEqual(1, courses.Count);
            Assert.AreEqual("C971 Mobile Dev", courses[0].Name);
        }

        [Test]
        public async Task AddAssessment_ShouldSaveAndRetrieve()
        {
            var assessment = new Assessment { Name = "Performance Assessment", Type = "Performance" };
            await _db.SaveAssessmentAsync(assessment);

            var assessments = await _db.GetAssessmentsAsync();
            Assert.AreEqual(1, assessments.Count);
            Assert.AreEqual("Performance Assessment", assessments[0].Name);
        }

        [Test]
        public async Task DeleteTerm_ShouldCascadeDeleteCoursesAndAssessments()
        {
            var term = new Term { Name = "Spring 2025", StartDate = DateTime.Now, EndDate = DateTime.Now.AddMonths(6) };
            await _db.SaveTermAsync(term);

            var course = new Course { Name = "Mobile Dev", InstructorEmail = "prof@wgu.edu", TermId = term.Id };
            await _db.SaveCourseAsync(course);

            var assessment = new Assessment { Name = "Final Project", Type = "Performance", CourseId = course.Id };
            await _db.SaveAssessmentAsync(assessment);

            // Delete term
            await _db.DeleteTermAsync(term);

            var terms = await _db.GetTermsAsync();
            var courses = await _db.GetCoursesAsync();
            var assessments = await _db.GetAssessmentsAsync();

            Assert.AreEqual(0, terms.Count);
            Assert.AreEqual(0, courses.Count);
            Assert.AreEqual(0, assessments.Count);
        }

        [Test]
        public void InvalidInstructorEmail_ShouldNotSave()
        {
            var course = new Course { Name = "Bad Email Course", InstructorEmail = "invalidemail" };

            Assert.ThrowsAsync<ArgumentException>(async () =>
            {
                await _db.SaveCourseAsync(course);
            });
        }

    }
}

3. Unit Test Results:
-All test cases passed successfully across the emulator.
-Database operations (CRUD) validated with unit tests.
-Notifications and Share button functionality tested manually due to OS integration.

4. Changes Resulting from Tests:
-Notifications: Initial test showed notifications not firing due to alerts set for 12:00AM on test day. Fixed by changing to DateTime.Now.AddSeconds(5), and restored to normal with explanatory comment after the fact.
-UI Navigation: Back navigation from Course → Term was inconsistent. Fixed by using Shell routing.
